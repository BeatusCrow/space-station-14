I tried to follow this template when creating prototypes:
1) First, "100% negative triggers" are listed (if any exist)
2) Then "negative triggers" are specified (they are exceptions for the department so they don't feel bad at their workplace) and "positive triggers"
3) Then "100% positive triggers" are listed
4) All triggers have the id GeneralTrigger_"trigger prototype"_"department"
5) Then the suffix Neg or Pos is added to the ID if the current prototype is both a positive and negative trigger... If it's only listed in one category, it's better not to add the suffix.
